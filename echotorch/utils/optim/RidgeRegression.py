        Parameters need to be specified as collections that have a deterministic
        ordering that is consistent between runs. Examples of objects that don't
        satisfy those properties are sets and iterators over values of dictionaries.

    Args:
        params (iterable): an iterable of :class:`torch.Tensor` s or
            :class:`dict` s. Specifies what Tensors should be optimized.
