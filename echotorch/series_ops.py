    The difference operator compute the difference between the time series :math:`x(t)` at time :math:`t` and :math:`t+1`.

    :param input: input timeseries.
    :type input: ``TimeTensor``
    :return: The difference between :math:`x` at time :math:`t` and :math:`t+1` as a ``TimeTensor``.

    Example:

        >>> x = echotorch.rand(5, time_length=100)
        >>> df = echotorch.diff(x)
